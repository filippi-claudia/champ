# Quantum Package and CHAMP
We will first use Quantum Package (QP) to generate two
single-determinant wave functions for the water molecule. A first one
with Hartree-Fock orbitals, and a second one with PBE Kohn-Sham
orbitals. Then, we will export these wave functions into the
[TREXIO](https://github.com/trex-coe/trexio) format, which is a general
format for storing arbitrary wave functions.
