# Solid-State Systems

This section covers workflows specific to periodic solid-state systems.

## Available Workflows

-   **[Supercell Construction](supercell_construction.md)**:  
    Setting up the simulation cell for periodic calculations.

-   **[VMC Optimization](vmc_optimization.md)**:  
    Optimizing the wavefunction for solids, including finite-size corrections.

-   **[DMC Equation of State](dmc_equation_of_state.md)**:  
    Calculating the energy vs. volume curve to determine lattice parameters and bulk moduli.

-   **[Defect Calculation](defect_calculation.md)**:  
    Calculating formation energies of point defects.
