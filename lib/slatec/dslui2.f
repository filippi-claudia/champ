C *Description:
C       This routine is supplied with  the SLAP package as a routine
C       to  perform  the  MSOLVE operation  in   the  SIR and   SBCG
C       iteration routines for  the  drivers DSILUR and DSLUBC.   It
C       must  be called  via   the  SLAP  MSOLVE  calling   sequence
C       convention interface routine DSLUI.

C       IL, JL, L should contain the unit lower triangular factor of
C       the incomplete decomposition of the A matrix  stored in SLAP
C       Row format.  IU, JU, U should contain  the unit upper factor
C       of the  incomplete decomposition of  the A matrix  stored in
C       SLAP Column format This ILU factorization can be computed by
C       the DSILUS routine. The diagonals (which are all one's) are
C       stored.
C
C       =================== S L A P Column format ==================
C
C       This routine  requires that  the matrix A  be stored in  the
C       SLAP Column format.  In this format the non-zeros are stored
C       counting down columns (except for  the diagonal entry, which
C       must appear first in each  "column")  and are stored  in the
C       double precision array A.   In other words,  for each column
C       in the matrix put the diagonal entry in  A.  Then put in the
C       other non-zero  elements going down  the column (except  the
C       diagonal) in order.   The  IA array holds the  row index for
C       each non-zero.  The JA array holds the offsets  into the IA,
C       A arrays  for  the  beginning  of each   column.   That  is,
C       IA(JA(ICOL)),  A(JA(ICOL)) points   to the beginning  of the
C       ICOL-th   column    in    IA and   A.      IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1),
C       A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to  the  end of the   ICOL-th column.
C       Note that we always have  JA(N+1) = NELT+1,  where N is  the
C       number of columns in  the matrix and NELT  is the number  of
C       non-zeros in the matrix.
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Column  storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|'  denotes the end of a
C       column):

C       ==================== S L A P Row format ====================
C
C       This routine requires  that the matrix A  be  stored  in the
C       SLAP  Row format.   In this format  the non-zeros are stored
C       counting across  rows (except for the diagonal  entry, which
C       must  appear first  in each  "row")  and  are stored  in the
C       double precision  array A.  In other words, for each row  in
C       the matrix  put the diagonal  entry in A.   Then put in  the
C       other  non-zero elements  going across  the row  (except the
C       diagonal) in order.  The JA array holds the column index for
C       each non-zero.  The IA array holds the offsets  into the JA,
C       A  arrays  for  the   beginning  of  each  row.    That  is,
C       JA(IA(IROW)),A(IA(IROW)) are the first elements of the IROW-
C       th row in  JA and A,  and  JA(IA(IROW+1)-1), A(IA(IROW+1)-1)
C       are  the last elements  of the  IROW-th row.   Note  that we
C       always have  IA(N+1) = NELT+1, where N is the number of rows
C       in the matrix  and  NELT is the  number of non-zeros  in the
C       matrix.

C       Matrix (in the A and JA arrays '|' denotes the end of a row):

C
C       With  the SLAP  format  the "inner  loops" of  this  routine
C       should vectorize   on machines with   hardware  support  for
C       vector gather/scatter operations.  Your compiler may require
C       a  compiler directive  to  convince   it that there  are  no
C       implicit vector  dependencies.  Compiler directives  for the
C       Alliant FX/Fortran and CRI CFT/CFT77 compilers  are supplied
C       with the standard SLAP distribution.
