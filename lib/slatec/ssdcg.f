C    $     ITMAX, ITER, ERR, IERR, IUNIT, RWORK, LENW, IWORK, LENIW )
C
C *Arguments:
C N      :IN       Integer.
C         Order of the Matrix.
C B      :IN       Real B(N).
C         Right-hand side vector.
C X      :INOUT    Real X(N).
C         On input X is your initial guess for solution vector.
C         On output X is the final approximate solution.
C NELT   :IN       Integer.
C         Number of Non-Zeros stored in A.
C IA     :INOUT    Integer IA(NELT).
C JA     :INOUT    Integer JA(NELT).
C A      :INOUT    Real A(NELT).
C         These arrays should hold the matrix A in either the SLAP
C         Triad format or the SLAP Column format.  See "Description",
C         below.  If the SLAP Triad format is chosen it is changed
C         internally to the SLAP Column format.
C ISYM   :IN       Integer.
C         Flag to indicate symmetric storage format.
C         If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored.
C         If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the upper
C         or lower triangle of the matrix is stored.
C ITOL   :IN       Integer.
C         Flag to indicate type of convergence criterion.
C         If ITOL=1, iteration stops when the 2-norm of the residual
C         divided by the 2-norm of the right-hand side is less than TOL.
C         If ITOL=2, iteration stops when the 2-norm of M-inv times the
C         residual divided by the 2-norm of M-inv times the right hand
C         side is less than TOL, where M-inv is the inverse of the
C         diagonal of A.
C         ITOL=11 is often useful for checking and comparing different
C         routines.  For this case, the user must supply the "exact"
C         solution or a very accurate approximation (one with an error
C         much less than TOL) through a common block,
C             COMMON /SSLBLK/ SOLN( )
C         If ITOL=11, iteration stops when the 2-norm of the difference
C         between the iterative approximation and the user-supplied
C         solution divided by the 2-norm of the user-supplied solution
C         is less than TOL.  Note that this requires the user to set up
C         the "COMMON /SSLBLK/ SOLN(LENGTH)" in the calling routine.
C         The routine with this declaration should be loaded before the
C         stop test so that the correct length is used by the loader.
C         This procedure is not standard Fortran and may not work
C         correctly on your system (although it has worked on every
C         system the authors have tried).  If ITOL is not 11 then this
C         common block is indeed standard Fortran.
C TOL    :INOUT    Real.
C         Convergence criterion, as described above.  (Reset if IERR=4.)
C ITMAX  :IN       Integer.
C         Maximum number of iterations.
C ITER   :OUT      Integer.
C         Number of iterations required to reach convergence, or
C         ITMAX+1 if convergence criterion could not be achieved in
C         ITMAX iterations.
C ERR    :OUT      Real.
C         Error estimate of error in final approximate solution, as
C         defined by ITOL.
C IERR   :OUT      Integer.
C         Return error flag.
C           IERR = 0 => All went well.
C           IERR = 1 => Insufficient space allocated for WORK or IWORK.
C           IERR = 2 => Method failed to converge in ITMAX steps.
C           IERR = 3 => Error in user input.
C                       Check input values of N, ITOL.
C           IERR = 4 => User error tolerance set too tight.
C                       Reset to 500*R1MACH(3).  Iteration proceeded.
C           IERR = 5 => Preconditioning matrix, M, is not positive
C                       definite.  (r,z) < 0.
C           IERR = 6 => Matrix A is not positive definite.  (p,Ap) < 0.
C IUNIT  :IN       Integer.
C         Unit number on which to write the error at each iteration,
C         if this is desired for monitoring convergence.  If unit
C         number is 0, no writing will occur.
C RWORK  :WORK     Real RWORK(LENW).
C         Real array used for workspace.
C LENW   :IN       Integer.
C         Length of the real workspace, RWORK.  LENW >= 5*N.
C IWORK  :WORK     Integer IWORK(LENIW).
C         Used to hold pointers into the real workspace, RWORK.
C         Upon return the following locations of IWORK hold information
C         which may be of use to the user:
C         IWORK(9)  Amount of Integer workspace actually used.
C         IWORK(10) Amount of Real workspace actually used.
C LENIW  :IN       Integer.
C         Length of the integer workspace, IWORK.  LENIW >= 10.
C
C *Description:
C       This  routine   performs preconditioned conjugate   gradient
C       method on  the  symmetric positive definite   linear  system
C       Ax=b.   The preconditioner is  M = DIAG(A), the  diagonal of
C       the matrix A.  This is the  simplest of preconditioners  and
C       vectorizes very well.   This routine is  simply a driver for
C       the SCG routine.  It  calls the SSDS  routine to  set up the
C       preconditioning  and  then  calls  SCG  with the appropriate
C       MATVEC and MSOLVE routines.
C
C       The Sparse Linear Algebra Package (SLAP) utilizes two matrix
C       data structures: 1) the  SLAP Triad  format or  2)  the SLAP
C       Column format.  The user can hand this routine either of the
C       of these data structures and SLAP  will figure out  which on
C       is being used and act accordingly.
C
C       =================== S L A P Triad format ===================
C
C       This routine requires that the  matrix A be   stored in  the
C       SLAP  Triad format.  In  this format only the non-zeros  are
C       stored.  They may appear in  *ANY* order.  The user supplies
C       three arrays of  length NELT, where  NELT is  the number  of
C       non-zeros in the matrix: (IA(NELT), JA(NELT), A(NELT)).  For
C       each non-zero the user puts the row and column index of that
C       matrix element  in the IA and  JA arrays.  The  value of the
C       non-zero   matrix  element is  placed  in  the corresponding
C       location of the A array.   This is  an  extremely  easy data
C       structure to generate.  On  the  other hand it   is  not too
C       efficient on vector computers for  the iterative solution of
C       linear systems.  Hence,   SLAP changes   this  input    data
C       structure to the SLAP Column format  for  the iteration (but
C       does not change it back).
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Triad   storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix.  Recall that the entries may appear in any order.

C       | 0  0  0 44  0|
C       |51  0 53  0 55|
C
C       =================== S L A P Column format ==================
C
C       This routine  requires that  the matrix A  be stored in  the
C       SLAP Column format.  In this format the non-zeros are stored
C       counting down columns (except for  the diagonal entry, which
C       must appear first in each  "column")  and are stored  in the
C       real array A.  In other words, for each column in the matrix
C       put the diagonal entry in A.  Then put in the other non-zero
C       elements going down   the  column (except  the diagonal)  in
C       order.  The IA array holds the row  index for each non-zero.
C       The JA array holds the offsets into the IA, A arrays for the
C       beginning of   each    column.    That  is,    IA(JA(ICOL)),
C       A(JA(ICOL)) points to the beginning of the ICOL-th column in
C       IA and  A.  IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1),  A(JA(ICOL+1)-1) points to the
C       end  of   the ICOL-th  column.  Note   that  we  always have
C       JA(N+1) = NELT+1, where  N  is the number of columns in  the
C       matrix and  NELT   is the number of non-zeros in the matrix.
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Column  storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|'  denotes the end of a
C       column):

C       |11 12  0  0 15|   A: 11 21 51 | 22 12 | 33 53 | 44 | 55 15 35
C       |21 22  0  0  0|  IA:  1  2  5 |  2  1 |  3  5 |  4 |  5  1  3

C       | 0  0  0 44  0|
C       |51  0 53  0 55|
C
C
C *Side Effects:
C       The SLAP Triad format (IA, JA, A) is modified internally  to
C       be the SLAP Column format.  See above.
C
C *Cautions:
C     This routine will attempt to write to the Fortran logical output
C     unit IUNIT, if IUNIT .ne. 0.  Thus, the user must make sure that
C     this logical unit is attached to a file or terminal before calling
C     this routine with a non-zero value for IUNIT.  This routine does
C     not check for the validity of a non-zero IUNIT unit number.
