# Excited States Calculation

This tutorial demonstrates how to perform excited state calculations using Quantum Package (QP) and CHAMP.

We will:

1.  Import a Hartree-Fock wavefunction for formaldehyde ($COH_2$).
2.  Run a two-state CIPSI calculation in QP.
3.  Export the wavefunctions for the ground and excited states to separate TREXIO files.
4.  Run wavefunction optimization and Diffusion Monte Carlo in CHAMP for both states.
