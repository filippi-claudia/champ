C         Order of the Matrix.
C B      :IN       Double Precision B(N).
C         Right-hand side vector.
C X      :INOUT    Double Precision X(N).
C         On input X is your initial guess for solution vector.
C         On output X is the final approximate solution.
C NELT   :IN       Integer.
C         Number of Non-Zeros stored in A.
C IA     :IN       Integer IA(NELT).
C JA     :IN       Integer JA(NELT).
C A      :IN       Double Precision A(NELT).
C         These arrays contain the matrix data structure for A.
C         It could take any form.  See "Description", below,
C         for more details.
C ISYM   :IN       Integer.
C         Flag to indicate symmetric storage format.
C         If ISYM=0, all non-zero entries of the matrix are stored.
C         If ISYM=1, the matrix is symmetric, and only the upper
C         or lower triangle of the matrix is stored.
C MATVEC :EXT      External.
C         Name of a routine which performs the matrix vector multiply
C         Y = A*X given A and X.  The name of the MATVEC routine must
C         be declared external in the calling program.  The calling
C         sequence to MATVEC is:
C             CALL MATVEC( N, X, Y, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM )
C         Where N is the number of unknowns, Y is the product A*X
C         upon return, X is an input vector, NELT is the number of
C         non-zeros in the SLAP IA, JA, A storage for the matrix A.
C         ISYM is a flag which, if non-zero, denotes that A is
C         symmetric and only the lower or upper triangle is stored.
C MSOLVE :EXT      External.
C         Name of a routine which solves a linear system MZ = R for
C         Z given R with the preconditioning matrix M (M is supplied via
C         RWORK and IWORK arrays).  The name of the MSOLVE routine must
C         be declared external in the calling program.  The calling
C         sequence to MSOLVE is:
C             CALL MSOLVE(N, R, Z, NELT, IA, JA, A, ISYM, RWORK, IWORK)
C         Where N is the number of unknowns, R is the right-hand side
C         vector and Z is the solution upon return.  NELT, IA, JA, A and
C         ISYM are defined as above.  RWORK is a double precision array
C         that can be used to pass necessary preconditioning information
C         and/or workspace to MSOLVE.  IWORK is an integer work array
C         for the same purpose as RWORK.
C ITOL   :IN       Integer.
C         Flag to indicate type of convergence criterion.
C         If ITOL=1, iteration stops when the 2-norm of the residual
C         divided by the 2-norm of the right-hand side is less than TOL.
C         If ITOL=2, iteration stops when the 2-norm of M-inv times the
C         residual divided by the 2-norm of M-inv times the right hand
C         side is less than TOL, where M-inv is the inverse of the
C         diagonal of A.
C         ITOL=11 is often useful for checking and comparing different
C         routines.  For this case, the user must supply the "exact"
C         solution or a very accurate approximation (one with an error
C         much less than TOL) through a common block,
C             COMMON /DSLBLK/ SOLN( )
C         If ITOL=11, iteration stops when the 2-norm of the difference
C         between the iterative approximation and the user-supplied
C         solution divided by the 2-norm of the user-supplied solution
C         is less than TOL.  Note that this requires the user to set up
C         the "COMMON /DSLBLK/ SOLN(LENGTH)" in the calling routine.
C         The routine with this declaration should be loaded before the
C         stop test so that the correct length is used by the loader.
C         This procedure is not standard Fortran and may not work
C         correctly on your system (although it has worked on every
C         system the authors have tried).  If ITOL is not 11 then this
C         common block is indeed standard Fortran.
C TOL    :INOUT    Double Precision.
C         Convergence criterion, as described above.  (Reset if IERR=4.)
C ITMAX  :IN       Integer.
C         Maximum number of iterations.
C ITER   :OUT      Integer.
C         Number of iterations required to reach convergence, or
C         ITMAX+1 if convergence criterion could not be achieved in
C         ITMAX iterations.
C ERR    :OUT      Double Precision.
C         Error estimate of error in final approximate solution, as
C         defined by ITOL.
C IERR   :OUT      Integer.
C         Return error flag.
C           IERR = 0 => All went well.
C           IERR = 1 => Insufficient space allocated for WORK or IWORK.
C           IERR = 2 => Method failed to converge in ITMAX steps.
C           IERR = 3 => Error in user input.
C                       Check input values of N, ITOL.
C           IERR = 4 => User error tolerance set too tight.
C                       Reset to 500*D1MACH(3).  Iteration proceeded.
C           IERR = 5 => Preconditioning matrix, M, is not positive
C                       definite.  (r,z) < 0.
C           IERR = 6 => Matrix A is not positive definite.  (p,Ap) < 0.
C IUNIT  :IN       Integer.
C         Unit number on which to write the error at each iteration,
C         if this is desired for monitoring convergence.  If unit
C         number is 0, no writing will occur.

C Z      :WORK     Double Precision Z(N).
C DZ     :WORK     Double Precision DZ(N).

C         Double Precision array that can be used by  MSOLVE.
C IWORK  :WORK     Integer IWORK(USER DEFINED).
C         Integer array that can be used by  MSOLVE.
C
C *Description:
C       The basic algorithm for iterative refinement (also known as
C       iterative improvement) is:
C
C            n+1    n    -1       n
C           X    = X  + M  (B - AX  ).
C
C           -1   -1
C       If M =  A then this  is the  standard  iterative  refinement
C       algorithm and the "subtraction" in the  residual calculation
C       should be done in double precision (which it is  not in this
C       routine).
C       If M = DIAG(A), the diagonal of A, then iterative refinement
C       is  known  as  Jacobi's  method.   The  SLAP  routine  DSJAC
C       implements this iterative strategy.
C       If M = L, the lower triangle of A, then iterative refinement
C       is known as Gauss-Seidel.   The SLAP routine DSGS implements
C       this iterative strategy.
C
C       This routine does  not care  what matrix data   structure is
C       used for  A and M.  It simply   calls  the MATVEC and MSOLVE
C       routines, with  the arguments as  described above.  The user
C       could write any type of structure and the appropriate MATVEC
C       and MSOLVE routines.  It is assumed  that A is stored in the
C       IA, JA, A  arrays in some fashion and  that M (or INV(M)) is
C       stored  in  IWORK  and  RWORK)  in  some fashion.   The SLAP
C       routines DSJAC and DSGS are examples of this procedure.
C
C       Two  examples  of  matrix  data structures  are the: 1) SLAP
C       Triad  format and 2) SLAP Column format.
C
C       =================== S L A P Triad format ===================
C
C       In  this   format only the  non-zeros are  stored.  They may
C       appear  in *ANY* order.   The user  supplies three arrays of
C       length NELT, where  NELT  is the number  of non-zeros in the
C       matrix:  (IA(NELT), JA(NELT),  A(NELT)).  For each  non-zero
C       the  user puts   the row  and  column index   of that matrix
C       element in the IA and JA arrays.  The  value of the non-zero
C       matrix  element is  placed in  the corresponding location of
C       the A  array.  This is  an extremely easy data  structure to
C       generate.  On  the other hand it  is  not too  efficient  on
C       vector  computers   for the  iterative  solution  of  linear
C       systems.  Hence, SLAP  changes this input  data structure to
C       the SLAP   Column  format for the  iteration (but   does not
C       change it back).
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Triad   storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix.  Recall that the entries may appear in any order.
C
C           5x5 Matrix      SLAP Triad format for 5x5 matrix on left.
C                              1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
C       |11 12  0  0 15|   A: 51 12 11 33 15 53 55 22 35 44 21
C       |21 22  0  0  0|  IA:  5  1  1  3  1  5  5  2  3  4  2
C       | 0  0 33  0 35|  JA:  1  2  1  3  5  3  5  2  5  4  1
C       | 0  0  0 44  0|
C       |51  0 53  0 55|
C
C       =================== S L A P Column format ==================
C
C       In  this format   the non-zeros are    stored counting  down
C       columns (except  for the diagonal  entry, which must  appear
C       first  in each "column") and are  stored in the  double pre-
C       cision array  A. In  other  words,  for each  column  in the
C       matrix  first put  the diagonal entry in A.  Then put in the
C       other non-zero  elements going  down the column  (except the
C       diagonal)  in order.  The IA array  holds the  row index for
C       each non-zero.  The JA array  holds the offsets into the IA,
C       A  arrays  for  the  beginning  of  each  column.  That  is,
C       IA(JA(ICOL)),A(JA(ICOL)) are the first elements of the ICOL-
C       th column in IA and A, and IA(JA(ICOL+1)-1), A(JA(ICOL+1)-1)
C       are  the last elements of the ICOL-th column.   Note that we
C       always have JA(N+1)=NELT+1, where N is the number of columns
C       in the matrix  and NELT  is the number  of non-zeros  in the
C       matrix.
C
C       Here is an example of the  SLAP Column  storage format for a
C       5x5 Matrix (in the A and IA arrays '|'  denotes the end of a
C       column):
C

C       |11 12  0  0 15|   A: 11 21 51 | 22 12 | 33 53 | 44 | 55 15 35
C       |21 22  0  0  0|  IA:  1  2  5 |  2  1 |  3  5 |  4 |  5  1  3
C       | 0  0 33  0 35|  JA:  1  4  6    8  9   12
C       | 0  0  0 44  0|
C       |51  0 53  0 55|
C
C *Examples:
C       See the SLAP routines DSJAC, DSGS
C
C *Cautions:
C     This routine will attempt to write to the Fortran logical output
C     unit IUNIT, if IUNIT .ne. 0.  Thus, the user must make sure that
C     this logical unit is attached to a file or terminal before calling
C     this routine with a non-zero value for IUNIT.  This routine does
C     not check for the validity of a non-zero IUNIT unit number.
