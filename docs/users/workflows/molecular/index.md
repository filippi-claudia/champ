# Molecular Systems

This section covers workflows specific to isolated molecular systems.

## Available Workflows

-   **[VMC Optimization](vmc_optimization.md)**:  
    Optimizing the wavefunction (Jastrow, orbitals) using Variational Monte Carlo.

-   **[VMC → DMC Workflow](vmc_dmc.md)**:  
    A complete workflow starting from VMC optimization and proceeding to a production DMC calculation.

-   **[DMC Forces](dmc_forces.md)**:  
    Calculating atomic forces in DMC for geometry optimization or vibrational analysis.

-   **[Excitation Energy](excitation_energy.md)**:  
    Calculating vertical excitation energies using state-specific or state-average optimization.

-   **[Open-shell Systems](open_shell_systems.md)**:  
    Specific considerations for open-shell molecules (unpaired electrons).
