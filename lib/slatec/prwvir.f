C***BEGIN PROLOGUE  PRWVIR
C***SUBSIDIARY
C***PURPOSE  Subsidiary to SPLP
C***LIBRARY   SLATEC
C***TYPE      SINGLE PRECISION (PRWVIR-S, DPRWVR-D)

C***DESCRIPTION
C
C     PRWVIR LIMITS THE TYPE OF STORAGE TO A SEQUENTIAL SPARSE MATRIX
C     STORAGE SCHEME.  THE PAGE STORAGE IS ON RANDOM ACCESS DISK.
C     PRWVIR IS PART OF THE SPARSE LP PACKAGE, SPLP.
C
C     KEY       IS A FLAG WHICH INDICATES WHETHER A READ OR WRITE
C               OPERATION IS TO BE PERFORMED. A VALUE OF KEY=1 INDICATES
C               A READ. A VALUE OF KEY=2 INDICATES A WRITE.
C     IPAGE     IS THE PAGE OF MATRIX MN WE ARE ACCESSING.
C     LPG       IS THE LENGTH OF THE PAGE.
C   SX(*),IX(*) IS THE MATRIX DATA.
C
C     THIS SUBROUTINE IS A MODIFICATION OF THE SUBROUTINE LRWVIR,
C     SANDIA LABS. REPT. SAND78-0785.

C***FIRST EXECUTABLE STATEMENT  PRWVIR
C
C     COMPUTE STARTING ADDRESS OF PAGE.
C
      IPAGEF=SX(3)
      ISTART = IX(3) + 5
C
C     OPEN RANDOM ACCESS FILE NUMBER IPAGEF, IF FIRST PAGE WRITE.
C
      FIRST=SX(4).EQ.ZERO
      IF (.NOT.(FIRST)) GO TO 20002
      CALL SOPENM(IPAGEF,LPG)
      SX(4)=ONE
C
C     PERFORM EITHER A READ OR A WRITE.
C
20002 IADDR = 2*IPAGE - 1
      IF (.NOT.(KEY.EQ.1)) GO TO 20005
      CALL SREADP(IPAGEF,IX(ISTART),SX(ISTART),LPG,IADDR)
      GO TO 20006
20005 IF (.NOT.(KEY.EQ.2)) GO TO 10001
      CALL SWRITP(IPAGEF,IX(ISTART),SX(ISTART),LPG,IADDR)
