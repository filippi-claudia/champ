This test was added to test the VMC state-specific
sr_n optimization method implemented in CHAMP. 
The state-specific method allows for a unique jastrow 
and set of lcao to be optimized for each state 
(as well as CI/CSF expansion).

Where the input files came from.

A CAS(12,9) calculation was performed in GAMESS on a
nitroxyl (HNO) molecule. The output file is provided:

'./conversion/cas129_b3lyp_BFD-dan-normf0.out' 

The MCSCF orbitals were used in a 2-state CIPSI 
calculation in QUANTUM PACKAGE. The output file is
provided:

'./conversion/cas129_b3lyp_BFD-dan-normf0-525475-2to300.ezfio.tar.gz'

use:

'tar -xzvf cas129_b3lyp_BFD-dan-normf0-525475-2to300.ezfio.tar.gz'

to extract

The CI(322)/CSF(143) expansions from QUANTUM PACKAGE,
MCSCF orbitals from GAMESS, and a jastrow were then
optimized extensively using the VMC state-specific 
sr_n method. These optimized parameters are used as
the input wave functions for this test.
